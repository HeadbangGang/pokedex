# Pokédex

[Pokédex](https://www.pokedex.taydenflitcroft.com) is a web app that generates all Pokémon currently included in The Pokémon Company's "National Pokédex" with their Pokédex index, type(s), and both standard and "Shiny" sprites. Pokédex leverages my [Global Backend](https://github.com/HeadbangGang/global-backend) project by acting as an API layer between the front end project and the fully open-sourced [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) that the data originates from.
